# blogs-scala #

This is just a place for me to keep sample code from blogposts that I follow
along with.  I've separated Java blogposts into two categories.  blogs-gradle and
blogs-maven.  That way I can start a new project in the root directory and
recursively import all gradle or maven projects into a larger project to look at
them.  

I've also made a blogs-clojure repo for when I follow along with clojure
blogs, and I may need a blogs-scala later.  Kotlin projects will probably end up
in blogs-gradle, since they don't really have an associated buildtool.  They
might be mixed into maven too.  I read blogs on a lot of different topics, but I
haven't been saving all my work.  Hopefully with the projects in one place, I'll
have a reliable way to refresh my memory about something I read once.

I've been doing one repo per course when following along with courses, but this
is simply unsustainable with blogposts, since there are so many.
